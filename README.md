Due to an issue in SAS Miner I couldn't save the data source or save the sas file to the desktop 
I have a Mac laptop and sas miner also talend data preparation could not work on mac I needed to reinstall window Virtual Machine but sas wasn't also wroking 
properly and I couldnt save my file to the destop so I had to save each node individually some file were lost for talned due to the window virtual machine.

DATA:
DataCustomer.xlsx
DATA AFTER SAMPLING AND IMPUTATION:
sampled.xlsx
DATA AFTER CHECKING FOR DUPLICATE ROWS IN TALNED:
sampledUniq.csv
some formatting issue occurred when in this step so it was handel using Talend data preparation and clean data were used for modeling
